Whistler Blackcomb  Winter 2004
 
 This isn't just snowboarding It's a frozen time capsule from a week we still dream about.
 
We were just a bunch of friends chasing something pure  untouched snow, steep lines, and the kind of stoke you don't find in daily life. We booked First Tracks Lodge before we even had proper jobs, showed up with gear held together by duct tape, and lucked out with over 40 inches of fresh powder in just a few days.
 
No GoPros. No drones. No socials. Just shaky camcorders, analog vibes, and the ride of our lives.
 
This trip didn't make us influencers  it made us believers.
 
 Whistler Blackcomb that year was on another level. Trees heavy with snow, bowls begging to be carved, and chairlift rides filled with laughter, numb fingers, and whispered stories about that one run we barely survived. And every night? Hot tubs, cheap, and memories tattooed on our hearts forever.
 
If you know, you know:
 
 The sound of bindings clicking in.
 That first untouched line of the morning.
 The silence of snowfall at 3 am.
 The sore legs that still feel worth it two decades later.
 
This video is for the OG riders, the powder chasers, the mountain dwellers, the dreamers, and anyone who's ever felt more alive carving down a mountain than anywhere else in the world.
 
 2004. No filters. Just soul turns.
 Tag your crew you rode with back then.
 Or the one you're riding with this winter in South America or New Zealand.
 Or the one you wish you could take back in time with you.
 
 Let's bring back this energy. Not just for the views  for the love of the ride.
 
Filmed: Whistler Blackcomb, BC
 Stayed: First Tracks Lodge
 Snowfall that week: 40+ inches of FRESH CANADIAN POW
 Riders: Friends. Family. Frostbitten fools.
 Soundtrack: Our laughter + that one scratched punk CD
 Style: Baggy pants. Beanies under helmets. Unmatched vibes.
